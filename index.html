				<div>Greetings! My name is Richard Way. I am a student studying Digital Media Arts at the University of

					been completing projects in a formal academic setting. I've dabbled in modding, server hosting,
					application development, graphic and UI design, digital art, and even music creation. I have a
					passion for digital art of all kinds, and am looking forward to sharing my experience with you!
